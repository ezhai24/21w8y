### Emily Zhai | [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emily-zhai-b7b32a103/)
An *unofficial* portfolio for the Unsplash photographer Mateusz Delegacz, perhaps better known as 21w8y. This project is an attempt to replicate Mateusz's own [Dribbble shot](https://dribbble.com/shots/6868117-21W8Y-Interaction). However, it is much more an exercise in translating designs into code and implementing practical front-end animations for my own benefit than anything else.

Built with many things including...
